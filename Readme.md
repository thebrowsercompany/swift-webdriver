# webdriver-swift

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/webdriver-swift/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/webdriver-swift/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

A Swift library for UI automation of apps and browsers via communication with [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/) endpoints, such as [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [Appium](http://appium.io/) or the [Windows Application Driver](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver).

`webdriver-swift` is meant to support both the [Selenium legacy JSON wire protocol](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/legacy/json_wire_protocol/) and its successor, the W3C-standard [WebDriver protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/), against any WebDriver endpoint. In practice, it has been developed and tested for WinAppDriver-based scenarios on Windows, and may have gaps in other environments.

## Usage

A `webdriver-swift` "Hello world" using `WinAppDriver` might look like this:

```swift
let session = Session(
    webDriver: WinAppDriver.start(), // Requires WinAppDriver to be installed on the machine
    desiredCapabilities: WinAppDriver.Capabilities.startApp(name: "notepad.exe"))
session.findElement(byName: "close")?.click()
```

To use `webdriver-swift` in your project, add a reference to it in your `Package.swift` file as follows:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/webdriver-swift", branch: "main")
    ],
    targets: [
        .testTarget(
            name: "UITests",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "WebDriver", package: "webdriver-swift"),
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

Build and run tests using `swift build` and `swift test`, or use the [Swift extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang).

For additional examples, refer to the `Tests\WebDriverTests` directory.

## Architecture

The library has two logical layers:

- **Wire layer**: The `WebDriver` and `Request` protocols and their implementations provide a strongly-typed representation for sending REST requests to WebDriver endpoints. Each request is represented by a struct under `Requests`. The library can be used and extended only at this layer if desired.
- **Session API layer**: The `Session` and `Element` types provide an object-oriented representation of WebDriver concepts with straightforward functions for every supported command such as `findElement(id:)` and `click()`.

Where WebDriver endpoint-specific functionality is provided, such as for launching and using a WinAppDriver instance, the code is kept separate from generic WebDriver functionality as much as possible.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions for:
- Additional command bindings from the WebDriver and Selenium legacy JSON wire protocols
- Improved support for other platforms and WebDriver endpoints

Please include tests with your submissions. Tests launching apps should rely only on GUI applications that ship with the Windows OS, such as notepad.
